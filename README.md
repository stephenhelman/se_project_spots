# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Grid/Flex

**Intro**

- This project is the project for Sprint 3 at Triple Ten. It is the culmination of HTML and CSS.
- In this project I utilized media queries, grid layouts, as well as flex-box layouts

**Figma**

- With this project, we utilized a Figma made design, rather than a design inside of a PDF.
- We had to learn to navigate the Figma interface in order to determine our margins, padding, font-sizes, and every aspect of sizing and styes involved in the project.

**Grid/Flex**

- To create the card layout, I utilized a grid design
- This allowed me to create a responsive grid design that would require little code changes to make it responsive on may different screen sizes
- TO help align and center the text and buttons, I utilized a flex box layout.
- Flex allows me to easily spread out elements that are on the far sides of pages without having to manually place the items, or adjusting margins.

I hope you enjoy my Spots Project!
